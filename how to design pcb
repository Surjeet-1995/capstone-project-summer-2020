// to design PCB in easyEda software we first need to design the schematics of circuit.

// designing circuit is easy way however you can go to file > create > pcb design on homepage to directly design pcb without creating schematics.

// after  creating schematics go to > convert to pcb option in pcb tool of easyEDA.

// this tool will convert the schematics into pcb layer.

// first you need to arrange the components in layer. 

// track and via are the most used tool in pcb designing to make connection.

// Easyeda has the autoroute feature from which we can get help of software automated  system, who create routes for our design.

// copper pour option is in pcb tool

// we can also import and export this file in different format.
